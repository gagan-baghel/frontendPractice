This is a prototype for a blog website created using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The website is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly. It has a simple layout with a navigation bar at the top, followed by a hero
image and then the blog posts. The navigation bar includes links to different pages such as Home, About Us, Contact Us and Blog. 

The homepage displays the latest blog posts in a grid layout with each post having its own featured image. The user can click on
each post to read more about it. 

The About Us page provides an overview of the website and its purpose.
It also includes contact information for the website owners. 

The Contact Us page allows users to submit inquiries or feedback about the website or its content. 

The Blog page displays all of the blog posts in chronological order with each post having its own featured image and title. The user can click on each post to read more about it. 

This prototype was created using Bootstrap for the HTML/CSS framework, JavaScript for interactivity, and jQuery for DOM manipulation.
